Double posting is a problem because:

During GET: The browser is producing the screen's location or position.

During POST: Allowing the developer to put out onto the screen what is necessary 
i.e. a form, a list, etc.

Double posting is a problem because it takes up space. In order to make sure you are saving space it redirects.
